Mentoring in comparative genomics
================
Megan Barkdull

## Introduction

We have two big goals for our time working together:

1.  Running comparative genomics analyses to understand how genes
    related to traits we are interested are evolving across ants.
2.  To learn the computational and bioinformatic skills that will make
    those analyses possible.

## Getting started with Bash

You will be using a lot of different programs in your project:
Orthofinder, BUSTED-PH, RELAX, and maybe others. In order to use those
tools effectively, youâ€™ll need to become comfortable with Bash
scripting. Today, we will practice by working on a script to download
ant genomes.
